# boilerplate-graphql-express-typescript
A starter project for setting up express graphql server that uses typescript


* Fork this repo
* Rename your repo according to the app you're building

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[your-account]/[your-app].git
cd [your-app] && npm i
```

To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code, run `npm run dev`. 


The client will be available on http://localhost:8080 and the server on http://localhost:3000. Note that you will still need to manage CORS between the two, as they are on different ports.
